**MORE**
I have done the big idea twice and from that gotten a silver stem award and came runner up. I spent a two months writing my business plan and discussing things with the mentors. i researched advertisement and the cost os production whilst also designing this as a 3d model. My idea was a food compactor that used hydraulics and smart systems to turn food waste to compost and in the process reduce food waste. The produced compost would be sold to farmers and gardening centers whilst any liquid would be collected at the bottom in a tank and turned into eco friendly fertilizer.
